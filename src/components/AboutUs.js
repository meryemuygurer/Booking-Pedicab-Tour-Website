                            <p>During the Pandemic almost all of the native New York pedicab tour guides left the business.

                                In 2022, Night (our founder) decided to bring together some of the last remaining native New York pedicab tour guides, 
                                each with over 15 years experience and knowledge to provide the best pedicab tour experience possible.

                    We are not a company. We are just a few tour guides who know Central Park and New York City like the back of our hands working together to make all of our clients happy during their visit to the Big Apple.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Our tours are fun and educational whether your a big kid, little kid or an adult and we are right next to you throughout the entire tour to tell you about what you see and take your pictures so you, your family, and friends have wonderful memories to look back on.
                    <br></br>

                    95% of New York City pedicab drivers have only recently arrived and know little about the city or Central Park which is why they will just drop passengers off in an area, and just tell them to come back in a couple of minutes.
