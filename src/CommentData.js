    Guide". We agreed the 3 hrs tour upfront with some extra spots we want to visit. He picked us up at our Hard Rock Hotel in Manhattan. 
    The rickshaw/pedicab was in a very good condition (with free water) and it was so much fun to cruise thru the traffic of this great city.
    We made a lot of photo stops and we were able to see all the spots we requested. Additional showed us some very nice places on top. 
    It was such a great tour because was so Experiences and explained us so many things of NYC.
    
    At the end we had a 4hrs trip with no extra charges and a great experience, with a very funny and safe guide. Immediately after our tour
    we received over 200 photos taken by our guide and more than 30 recommendations for very good restaurants, ice cream parlors, things to 
    do with kids in New York. 
    It was fantastic all around! Absolute recommendation to book this trip!!! We will come back in August 2024 `

    A rave review for Night Your NYC Guide (we had Chris). We pre-booked the Central Park tour (movie landmark tour for my kids 6 and 10yrs 
    old, who are Home Alone obsessed) and ended up having such an incredible experience that we rescheduled our itinerary later in the week 
    to be able to squeeze in another pedicab tour of downtown with Chris. These tours were the highlight of our trip for many reasons; 
    first and foremost, Chris was incredibly friendly and we felt very safe riding in the pedicab. Second, Chris is a native New Yorker 
    with a wealth of information that he shared in age appropriate ways for my kids and myself. Third, he tailored our tours to our specific 
    interests (my oldest daughter, like many tweens, is Taylor Swift obsessed) and he went out of his way to show her Taylor‚Äôs former and 
    current apartments. Fourth, we covered a lot of ground and saw an incredible amount of sights‚Ä¶ there is no way we‚Äôd have been able to 
    find these hidden gems ourselves. Finally, the photos Chris took of us during the tour were professional quality and are incredible 
    mementos from our trip.
    We can‚Äôt wait to return to NYC and do more tours with Night Your NYC Guide! 
    Definitely add this to your NYC itinerary.`

    absolutely fabulous! 
    Me and my partner booked the 90 minute tour of Central Park. 
    We thoroughly enjoyed every minute listening to our guide and learning the history of the park. Chris made it fun and took lots of 
    photos for us which is lovely to look back on. My favourite part was at each spot Chris would bring out his phone and show us multiple 
    movie clips that had been filmed at the very spot we were standing at. 
    Chris was accommodating and attentive, handing out hand warmers and ponchos when the weather took a turn out the blue!
    I would 100% recommend this tour. Visiting Central Park simply wouldn‚Äôt be the same had we had not booked the tour.
    Book it, you won‚Äôt regret it! Thank you again!! ‚ù§Ô∏è`

    express the sheer gratitude I have for Chris and the Night Your Tour Guide team. My family of 3 enjoyed an amazing 1.5 hour pedicab tour 
    last Sunday. The communication leading up to our trip was superb. Chris and team went out of their way to make a genuine connection, 
    provide numerous recommendations for restaurants, other attractions, etc. We felt like we knew Chris before we even arrived. Our Central 
    Park tour was the highlight of our NYC trip. His love/passion for his city is contagious, his knowledge is second to none and his 
    attention to detail is much appreciated. This is a tour not to be missed. Beware many pedicab tours in NYC are run by those that have 
    zero knowledge and not from NYC. They also cost far more. 
    Chris and team are lifelong natives which makes a huge difference. 
    Thank you again for the gift of your time and expertise, Chris!! 
    We will be recommending whenever possible!
    Ps: not only is he the hostess with the mostess, his photo skills are on point!! Memories we will cherish for a lifetime.`

    from a quick weekend getaway and found the recommendation for Night Your NYC Guide from this group. Night was so much fun and we could 
    not recommend him more!  My boys are 6 and 9 and we all 4 could fit comfortably in the pedal cab. We did his City Tour and he took us 
    around at our leisure for almost 4 hours.  We saw more of the city than we EVER would have covered by ourself...and we didn't get hot 
    r tired! üôÇ 
    Night took us to High-line Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, Chelsea Market, Greenwich, Little Italy, China Town, Wall Street 
    Bull, Ghostbusters site, Friends apartment, Sex and the City apartment, Freedom Tower, and more not to mention the cutest ice cream shop,
    amazing pizza place, and famous cookie spots! And he took great pictures everywhere we went!  I literally have like 100 more pictures he 
    took of our family that day!  He also played fun music!  When we were headed to see Ghostbusters, he played their theme song, same for 
    Sex and the City and Friends.  He made it really fun!! We had so much fun when our tour was over we went out on our own a couple of hours
    and then headed to Central Park, where I called him and asked him if he woud come meet us there and he took us around another couple of 
    hours! My boys loved seeing where Home Alone 2 and Elf were filmed, feeding turtles, and more!  
    Could not recommend him more!`

    most amazing holiday in NYC! The highlight of our trip has to be the 3 & 1/2 pedicab city tour Night Your NYC Guide. Chris is a lovely 
    man, he has lived in NYC his whole life and absolutely knows what he‚Äôs talking about. He asked what we would like to see and tailored 
    the experience for us. We saw so much, probably stuff we wouldn‚Äôt have got to see on foot. He took the most amazing pictures and I could 
    not recommend him more. üòòüóΩ`

    booked a Pedicab for a guided tour of Central Park. This was amazing, both my husband and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. Chris was our tour
    guide. We both felt he went over and above to give us the best experience. Chris‚Äô knowledge of the park is second to none and it was also
    fun to visit certain places within the park from some of our favourite movies!
    Chris, it really was a pleasure to meet you and your tour was definitely one of the highlights from our visit.  Thank You also for being 
    a great photographer and capturing some of our special moments.
    If you go to NYC, you MUST book Night Your NYC Guide for a Central Park Tour. üá∫üá∏ üëå`

    review for Night Your NYC Guide for pedicab tours in Central Park! I booked 2 pedicabs for our family of 5 and Chris was our tour guide! 
    He was soooo good! He took all these amazing photos of our family and gave us a great tour with history and all the movie references 
    (my kids faves). 
    I highly recommend using Night Your Guide and specifically Chris for a pedicab tour in Central Park. It was for sure a trip highlight 
    for us and I‚Äôm so grateful for the family pics!`
